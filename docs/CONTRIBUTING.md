# Contributing

Thanks for your interest in contributing! Please follow these guidelines:

- Fork the repository and open a pull request with a clear description of your changes.
- Add tests or examples for new formatters in `examples/`.
- Follow the coding style used in the packages (CommonJS modules, minimal dependencies).
- If adding a new formatter package, include a `README.md` and a `package.json`.
- Keep commits small and focused.

If your change is larger or adds a new calendar implementation, please open an issue first to discuss the plan.
